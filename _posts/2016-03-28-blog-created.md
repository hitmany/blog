I created a blog for the notes which helped me and maybe will help you. 

I am using Github Pages as blog platform

Why Github Pages?

- Free, no ads, no registration and SMS
- Quick installation, does not require learning additional programming languages
- Hosted by great [corporation](http://github.com){:target="_blank"} for developers
- Git
- Dont care about updates, security and server configuring
- Flexibility

There are tons of articles how to install Jekyll. But many articles are written for linux users which generating blog with Ruby on Linux desktop. 
I didn't want to waste time with Virtualbox and etc, I want to install Ruby, Python, Jekyll on [Windows](http://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/){:target="_blank"}.
Recommendations for Windows install:

>Install Ruby and Ruby DevKit with same bit
>You may need install [certificate](https://gist.github.com/fnichol/867550){:target="_blank"} if Jekyll will complain about SSL

I installed the blog in [subfolder](http://stackoverflow.com/a/29423406/2409592){:target="_blank"}.
I recommended this article by [Joshua Lande](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/){:target="_blank"} if you want install same blog
