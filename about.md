I write notes about the tricks, instructions and other information in this blog which helped me and I hope it will help you too

Sometimes solving issues takes a lot of time, sometimes I cant find answer in Google.
Maybe later the task will be solved again and the solution can not find.
I want to have an online collection of good solutions and articles.
